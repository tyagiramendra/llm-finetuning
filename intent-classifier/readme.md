Project Description: Intent Classification Fine-Tuning for Mental Health Status

Objective:
The project aims to develop and fine-tune an intent classification model specifically designed to predict mental health status based on users statement about his health. 

Scope:
Dataset Preparation: Collect and preprocess data from mental health forums, support chats, and relevant sources. Annotate the data with intent labels such as 'Normal','Anxiety','Personality disorder','Depression','Stress','Suicidal','Bipolar'.

Model Fine-Tuning: Utilizes a pre-trained transformer model flan-t5-small and fine-tune it on the annotated dataset to improve classification accuracy for mental health-specific intents.

Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and intent recall to ensure its effectiveness in predicting nuanced mental health status.
